# PCR-Project
Independent study seeking to understand the relationship between course ratings and enrollments, as well as predict enrollments. 
Quite a learning experience! My first real deep-dive into an analysis project solo. 
If I could go back and do it again I would've averaged the instructor and course quality ratings from the get go. Retrospectively that was the only cure for multi-collinearity here.
Learned the value of organized code too.
